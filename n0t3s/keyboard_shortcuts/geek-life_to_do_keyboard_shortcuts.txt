Shortcut key for a pane/element will be marked with underline.

Some shortcuts are global, some are contextual. Contextual shortcuts will be applied according to focused pane/element.
You'll see a currently focused pane bordered with double line.

In case writing in a text input (e,g, new project/task, due date), you have to Enter to submit/save.

Tips about using shortcuts efficiently:

The interface has 3 primary panels

    [P]rojects/Task lists
    [T]asks of selected project or Tasklist
    [D]etails/actions of selected Project or Task

The following diagram shows navigation shortcuts between the panels.

+------+----------------------+-----------------------+
|  P   |         T            |         D             |
|      |                      |                       |
|    Entr=>    ↓   ↑        Entr=>                    |
|      |       /   /          |                       |
|   <=Esc      j   k        <=Esc                     |
|      |                      |                       |

So, what it's trying to visualize is -

    Selecting an item with Enter will move you to right panel. That means -
        Selecting a Project will load it's tasks and move to Tasks panel
        Selecting a Task will load task detail and move to Detail panel
    Use Esc to move back to left panel. From Details to Tasks to Projects.
    To navigate a list (Project list or Task list),
        Use ↓ or j or Tab to go down
        Use ↑ or k or Shift+Tab to go up

Some More hints:

    If you are a vim user, think like -j/k for up/down list and h for go left
    Think Esc as a "step back" - to previous pane in most cases.
    When you're in a list (Projects or Tasks), Enter will load currently selected item.
    After creating new Project, focus will automatically move to Tasks. Start adding tasks immediately by pressing n.
    After creating new Task, focus will stay in "new task" input. So that you can add tasks quickly one after another.
    After creating new Task, Press Esc when you're done creating tasks.
